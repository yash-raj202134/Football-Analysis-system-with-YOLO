# Football-Analysis-system-with-YOLO


## Introduction
The primary goal of this project is to identify and monitor players, referees, and footballs in a video using YOLO, a leading AI object detection model. We plan to train the model further to enhance its performance. We will use K-means for pixel segmentation and clustering to categorize players into teams based on the colors of their uniforms. This data will enable us to determine each team's ball possession percentage during a match. Additionally, optical flow will be utilized to track camera movement across frames, allowing us to accurately gauge a player's movements. Perspective transformation will also be applied to account for the scene's depth and perspective, enabling us to measure a player's movement in meters instead of pixels. Ultimately, we will calculate a player's speed and the distance they cover.
